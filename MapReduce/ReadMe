For the equijoin :-
    InputFormatClass = TextInputFormat (therefore the input contains the offset value and each line)
    OutputFormatClass = TextOutputFormat


    Mapper :- 

    key = joining column (found by splitting the input text and taking the second value)
    value = entire row
    Also store two table names to be used in reducer


    reducer :-

    for all values of the given key in the reducer :-
    	seperately join the table1 values and table2 values in two lists
    if both the tables have values
    	iterate over these values and in nested loop and combine the values and store in one string maintaing the order of table1 then table2
    	write the output for this joining column
